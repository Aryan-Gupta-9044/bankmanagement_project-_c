This is a C program that implements a simple banking system with the following features:

- Allows users to create multiple customer records
- Displays all customer records
- Searches for a specific customer record by account number
- Deposits money into a customer's account
- Withdraws money from a customer's account (with PIN verification)

The program uses arrays to store customer information, including account number, name, address, PIN, and balance. It provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the banking system.

Here's a brief overview of the functions:

- display(): Displays all customer records
- sdisplay(): Displays a specific customer record
- search(): Searches for a customer record by account number
- deposit(): Deposits money into a customer's account
